            <p class="editor-letter">How are you feeling mentally, physically, and
                financially? This month is National Diabetes
                awareness month and inside you will find
                information on this. If you’re someone that is interested
                in getting your student loan debit forgiven, you’ll find
                information about that as well. Living a venerable life
                is what Dr. P discusses because we all have issues that
                affect us emotionally. Are you moving your body? Do
                you know that our bodies need motion to stay healthy?
                We invite you to read this and every issue from cover
                to cover to see if there is something that can assist you
                in improving your life. That’s why The Stalwart exists.
                We love our community, and we hope that you learn
                about Stalwart people that can offer information to help
                you along your life’s journey. Learning is important to
                this month’s Stalwart star Dr. Somerville, President of
                Owens Community College. She wants you to know
                that education is the key to a better future. We hope
                you are inspired by what you read and we hope that you
                exercise your right to vote! We wish you well.</p>
